/*
Layout Rules

CSS, by its very nature, is used to lay elements out on the page.
However, there is a distinction between layouts dictating the major
and minor components of a page. The minor components—such as a callout,
or login form, or a navigation item—sit within the scope of major
components such as a header or footer. I refer to the minor components
as Modules and will dive into those in the next section.
The major components are referred to as Layout styles.
